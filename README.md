DMC IOC CONTROL

DMC IOC stands for Delorean Motor Corp Internet Of Cars. This repository contains the source code for an iOS app that works with the WunderBar from https://relayr.io/wunderbar.

All the app code here was written during a hackathon and slapped in a single view controller not following the model view controller pattern. Given time this is a better approach. 

The dashboard:
